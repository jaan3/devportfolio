                    <p>
                        I remember How it all started when I became a web developer. 

			Before it all started I was making a living with helping people sharing them "Know-how" about how 
			sales and credit management can be done smartly and professionals can devote themselves to important 
			business activities. 
			Our partners we worked with, were able to use up-to-date link data, high-quality analytics and 
			top-notch know-how that helps businesses differentiate their competitors. 
			The company's name was Register OÜ, a fast-growing business intelligence and analytics marketplace 
			company whose mission is to optimize business processes for B2B-oriented companies Lead-to-Cash. 
			
			We all worked to ensure that of the next-generation CRM and ERP solutions would get the most out of their tools. 
			It was an interesting experience. For a more detailed description of my duties, see the contents of 
			my CV whitch you can download above.

			As you might have guessed, because it was an IT industry, we worked with the IT team in the company that 
			technically consulted our Sales Representatives team so that we could solve the most complex issues for our 
			customers. 
			This moment, when I realized that I was very interested in IT, came when I had been working with this 
			company for about eight months.

			At first I was planning to go to the IT specialty course, but it was financially impossible for me. 
			Because I had to go to work to make money. I started to explore ways to learn independently on the Internet. 
			As a person of great concentration, I was convinced that I could learn anything to become a good IT specialist.

			Then I found one web page called cybrary.it. I started CompTIA A + because I wanted to get clear about 
			different operating systems, networks, virtual machines, and more. I played a bit around with the knowledge I 
			learned, and there was interest in how to build web pages and platforms. Again, a friend of Google came in handy 
			for help. I took the first popular, which was www.w3schools.com. I went through all the HTML, CSS and 
			JavaScript sections. 
			Then, I began to explore how to actually put together the site and that everything worked perfectly. 
			Then I remembered one of the company's director of information network solutions, whom I met as a 
			representative of the Register OÜ company. He had one site called www.safaribooksonline.com on the screen. 
			Curious as I am, I reached out to him and I studied him about this website. Essentially this is a technology and
			business learning platform.
			In a word, I had everything in place to start my own education and find myself, 
			how and where to apply my knowledge.

			I started to look around the job market to find the right option for me.
			I found one interesting offer for a cruise ship company. My job was to prepare and serve a variety of 
			drinks for travelers. I liked this work precisely because of the flexible schedule. 
			I only worked about 6 hours a day, the rest of the time was leisure time. It was an ideal time to learn.

			As I mentioned before, I found WordPress. I studied this core-I went through various online courses, 
			I learned from different books and, of course, I practiced myself. 
			I started designing my website. Some of the first versions I built went broken. 
			I learned how to find a possible bug and fix it.

			Some of the most memorable projects can be found on the www.itprof.ee website.

			By the beginning of 2018, I began to explore JavaScript more deeply and for what it is capable of. 
			I was particularly interested in the MERN-stack. I use JavaScript since. There is a lot to learn. 
			I am trying to be more productive and dedicate myself to coding and 
			add development projects to the github.com page.

			My minus is that I have no work experience as a web developer. 
			I want to find a company where I can work in an energetic young team and become even better as a 
			web developer.
